Python files are used for reading from and writing to external files, making it easy to store and retrieve data in a structured manner.
Files in computing are data containers that store information or data, which can be text, binary, or a combination of both. They serve as a way to preserve, organize, and share data between computer programs and users. Files can come in various formats and extensions, each suited to specific types of data and applications. In the context of programming, file handling is crucial for tasks like reading, writing, and manipulating data stored in these files.
